The purpose of this project was to create a command line application that would ask a series of questions, then generate new html cards based of the answers from those questions.

## Instructions for use

The user will need to enter: node index.js in the integrated terminal to start the application.

## Test command

If you would like to run the implemented tests for the application then you can via the command line, then enter: npm test
